# 597_EntWebDev

This repository holds all deliverables made for CS 597: Enterprise Web Development taken at Boise State University during the Fall 2015 semester.

The website being built for this project is part of a research project proposed by Dr. Sole Pera. Her research area focuses on information retrieval and this project explores the area of web search for children. Because of time restraints, this website does not aim to solve the problems associated with this field but instead attempts to create a starting point with which to facilitate future work.

The main goals of this website include:
 - Setting up a database in order to store data collected from users with the purpose of creating a benchmark dataset.
 - Setting up a framework in which future tools can be implemented after more research has been completed.
 - Creating a custom web crawler/indexer of childrenâ€™s websites to compare with the Google Search API.
